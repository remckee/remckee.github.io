## Career goals

My short term career goals are to get a job as a software developer and to continue contributing to the Linux kernel. My preference would be to work for a company where I am paid to contribute to the Linux kernel as part of my job. If that does not happen right away, I am planning to continue contributing to the Linux kernel as a volunteer.

A longer-term career goal is to get an MS in Computer Science. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science in June, but I still want to learn more about topics that interest me in a structured environment. I am currently applying to programs. If am I accepted, I will start in January 2023.

## Skills and interests

My top interests are Linux kernel development, open source development, operating systems, and 3D graphics, in that order. I want to find a position related to at least one of those areas. I have experience with the memblock subsystem of the Linux kernel and enjoy working with it, but I would be open to learning other subsystems. I am also very comfortable with using the Linux command line.

I am proficient with C/C++ as well as CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript. I also have some experience with Bash shell scripting, GAWK, MASM assembly, Perl, PHP, Python, OpenGL, Rust, and SDL. I am very familiar with GitHub and git, including more advanced usages. For example, I am familiar with developing on a team via continuous integration workflows on Github and using interactive `git rebase` to modify, delete, insert, and reorder commits.

## Availability and job preferences

I am available to start working at the beginning of September. I am open to full-time, part-time, and self-employed contractor positions.

I would prefer a remote position, mainly because I am very accustomed to working remotely. I have been working remotely since 2015 (100% remote since 2018), and I am working remotely currently during my Outreachy internship. I would be willing to have a hybrid arrangement, depending on the location. I would strongly prefer locations in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon or possibly Washington) for positions that are not 100% remote. Although I currently live in Texas, I have lived here all my life and am ready for a change.
